# Spam Detection Model

The **Spam Detection Model** is a robust machine learning application designed to classify text messages as spam or not spam. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project provides an efficient solution for filtering unwanted messages. The application features an intuitive web interface powered by Streamlit, making it accessible and easy to use.

## Features

- **Accurate Spam Classification**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to reliably distinguish spam from legitimate messages.
- **Comprehensive NLP Preprocessing**: Employs spaCy for effective text cleaning and feature extraction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Deploys a clean, interactive web app via Streamlit for seamless user experience.
- **Modular Project Structure**: Well-organized codebase for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development
- **pandas**, **numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **spaCy**: NLP preprocessing and tokenization
- **Streamlit**: Web application deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eaglet001/Spam_detection_model.git
   cd Spam_detection_model
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLP Resources**
   - For spaCy users, download the required model (e.g., `en_core_web_sm`):
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser.
